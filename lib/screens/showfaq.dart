          "There is a bombardment of information, misinformation and even disinformation from multiple sources regarding Covid, leading to massive levels of confusion among even highly educated people, let alone the less educated ones.  Consequently, tens of  millions end up choosing to not get tested or vaccinated and millions to go to hospitals when not necessary. A huge number of people lose their health - or even lives - because they did not get treated on time. Covid Literacy is a must as people need to be constantly educated to discern between reliable and unreliable information so that they can take the best informed decisions possible in their own interests and that of those around them.

    Entry("What is Tonation? ", <Entry>[
      Entry(
          "Tonation in the context of Musopathy is about exhaling with diverse frequencies and various tonal textures through the mouth as well as the nose. The latter alone is usually referred to as phonation or humming.  But Musopathy uses Tonation in a comprehensive and holistic term and leverages on it for optimal benefits to the participants. This Tonation technique embedded in Musopathy not only leverages on the frequency produced by the person but can relax one and reduce anxiety and stress. "),

In Musopathy, we also leverage on pronal tonation - breathing out with any sustained tone for potentially higher benefits including reduction of anxiety.  Patients following the Musopathy pronal tonation have been able to increase their SPO2 levels by several points within a short time."),

It is anchored on published research by world class institutions like Harvard and Johns Hopkins but it is not a substitute for Allopathic Care. However, some of these techniques have improved lung function, increased Oxygen saturation (SPO2) levels, brought down high pulse rates, reduced chest congestion and also enabled many people to feel less anxious and depressed.
